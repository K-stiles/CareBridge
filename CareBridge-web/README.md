# Carebridge-Web

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with `[create-next-app](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app)`.

## Getting Started

pnpm is the package manager used for this project, so please get it installed if you want to run the project.
If you want to have the exact environment that I have, here it is:

| Number | Software | Version       |
| ------ | -------- | ------------- |
| 1      | node     | v18.12.1      |
| 2      | pnpm     | 8.6.0         |
| 3      | tsc      | Version 5.0.4 |
| 4      | Next     | v13           |

The versions do not matter too much for the most part just be relatively up-to-date, and it's good to check these. If you encounter any errors, it's good to check the versions first! ❗

To manage and switch between node versions, you can use:

- npm install -g n (what I use) 🌱
- nvm (a quick Google search should show you how to get that setup) 🌐

### Make sure your environment is properly set up before continuing. It will save you from a lot of issues down the line! ✅

### First, install the project dependencies 📦

```
pnpm install

```

<br>

## Run the application in dev mode 🚀

You will mostly need to do this when working on just UI/UX. No need to run the full application. In this mode, it will expose a localhost:3000, which you can connect to with your browser. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) with your browser to see the result. 🌐

```
pnpm dev

```

For more scripts and ways to run, you can check the `package.json`.

### Feel free to ask me questions on things you do not understand. ❓
